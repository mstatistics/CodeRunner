# OAuth Credentials

CodeRunner does not store passwords. Sign-in is handled by
[Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) using GitHub, Google, and/or
Microsoft as OAuth providers. **At least one provider must be configured** for
any non-demo deployment; without one, the login page has no working sign-in
button.

You only need multiple providers if you want students to choose between them;
configuring one is fine.

This page covers registering the OAuth apps and wiring the resulting
credentials into CodeRunner. The values you produce here are used the same way
whether you deploy [locally](./local.md) or to [Google Cloud](./gcloud.md);
only the URLs differ (`http://localhost:4000` vs `https://<your-domain>`).

## The two URLs you will need

Every OAuth app registration asks for a homepage/origin URL and a redirect
(callback) URL. For CodeRunner:

- **Homepage / origin** = your `BETTER_AUTH_URL` (the public base URL of the
  app).
- **Callback / redirect URL** = `BETTER_AUTH_URL` + a fixed per-provider path.
  Better Auth mounts its routes at `/api/auth` (confirmed in
  `apps/control/src/auth/auth.ts`), so the callbacks are:

  | Provider | Callback URL |
  | --- | --- |
  | GitHub | `<BETTER_AUTH_URL>/api/auth/callback/github` |
  | Google | `<BETTER_AUTH_URL>/api/auth/callback/google` |
  | Microsoft | `<BETTER_AUTH_URL>/api/auth/callback/microsoft` |

For local development that is `http://localhost:4000/api/auth/callback/github`
and `.../google` and `.../microsoft`. For the cloud VM it is
`https://<your-domain>/api/auth/callback/github` and `.../google` and
`.../microsoft`.

## Register a GitHub OAuth app

In GitHub: **Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps → New OAuth App**.

- **Application name:** anything (e.g. "CodeRunner - Team 1234").
- **Homepage URL:** your `BETTER_AUTH_URL`.
- **Authorization callback URL:** `<BETTER_AUTH_URL>/api/auth/callback/github`.

Save, then generate a client secret. You now have a **Client ID** and a
**Client Secret**.

## Register a Google OAuth client

In the Google Cloud console:

1. **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**: configure it once (External
   user type is fine for a team). Add your sign-in email as a test user while
   the app is in testing.
2. **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → OAuth client ID**,
   type **Web application**.
   - **Authorized JavaScript origins:** your `BETTER_AUTH_URL`.
   - **Authorized redirect URIs:** `<BETTER_AUTH_URL>/api/auth/callback/google`.

You now have a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret**.

## Register a Microsoft OAuth app

In the Microsoft Entra admin center:

1. **App registrations → New registration**.
2. Choose the account types you want to allow. The Better Auth provider uses
  the multi-tenant `common` authority by default, so either work accounts,
  personal accounts, or both can be supported depending on how you register
  the app.
3. Add a **Web** redirect URI of `<BETTER_AUTH_URL>/api/auth/callback/microsoft`.

After registration, create a client secret in **Certificates & secrets**. You
now have a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret**.

## Wire the credentials into CodeRunner

CodeRunner reads these from environment variables (see
`apps/control/src/config.ts` and [Configuration](../reference/configuration.md)):

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | Public base URL. **Must match** the homepage/callback URLs you registered. Defaults to `http://localhost:4000`. |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Secret used to sign sessions. **Change this in production**; the built-in default is a dev placeholder. Generate one with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | GitHub OAuth app client ID |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub OAuth app client secret |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth client ID |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth client secret |
| `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` | Microsoft OAuth app client ID |
| `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET` | Microsoft OAuth app client secret |

A provider only appears on the login page when **both** its ID and secret are
set. Where these values live depends on the deployment:

- **Local:** in your `.env` file. See [Local Deployment](./local.md).
- **Cloud VM:** in Google Secret Manager, materialized into the VM's `.env` by
  `render-env.sh` at boot. See [Google Cloud Deployment](./gcloud.md).

## Bootstrapping the first admin

OAuth establishes *who* a person is; CodeRunner separately controls *whether*
they may sign in (the allowlist) and *whether* they are an admin (the role).

### The easy path: `CODERUNNER_ADMIN_EMAIL`

Set `CODERUNNER_ADMIN_EMAIL` (comma-separated for multiple people) alongside
your OAuth credentials before the first startup and the two steps below happen
automatically — **no exec commands needed**. At startup the control plane adds
each listed email to the allowlist, and on first OAuth sign-in the account is
created with the admin role. An account that already exists with that email is
promoted to admin at the next startup, so it also rescues a coach who signed in
before the env var was set.

```bash
CODERUNNER_ADMIN_EMAIL=coach@frcteam.org,assistant@frcteam.org
```

This is the recommended way to reach the admin panel on a fresh deployment. The
manual commands below are still useful for allowlisting students and for
changing roles later.

### Manual bootstrap and later changes

:::note[Running these commands]

On a containerized deployment (the default) the `allowlist` and `users`
commands run **inside the control container** via the `coderunner` CLI:

```bash
docker compose exec control coderunner allowlist add coach@frcteam.org
docker compose exec control coderunner users promote coach@frcteam.org
```

Use `docker compose run --rm control <subcommand>` instead while the control
plane is stopped. On the Google Cloud VM the compose project lives in
`/opt/coderunner` and needs `sudo` (`cd /opt/coderunner && sudo docker compose
exec -T control …`). The `bun run …` short forms shown below are equivalent
and apply to a from-source host checkout with Bun.

:::

### 1. Allowlist the emails that may sign in

The allowlist gates every OAuth login. Until an email or domain is added,
sign-in is blocked for everyone. Add an individual email or a whole domain:

```bash
bun run allowlist:add coach@frcteam.org
# or allow an entire domain:
bun run allowlist:add frcteam.org
```

Other allowlist commands: `bun run allowlist:list`, `bun run allowlist:remove`.

### 2. Promote the first admin

Every user, including the first one, signs in as a regular user. After the
first coach has signed in once (so their user row exists), promote them to
admin:

```bash
bun run users:promote coach@frcteam.org
```

The reverse is `bun run users:demote`, and `bun run users:list` shows current
roles. On the cloud VM, run `coderunner users promote` over IAP SSH; see the
[Google Cloud Deployment](./gcloud.md) "Become the first admin" step.

> Admins also get a break-glass option: setting the `ADMIN_TOKEN` env var lets
> you call the `/admin/*` API with a bearer token even before any user is
> promoted. See [Configuration](../reference/configuration.md).
