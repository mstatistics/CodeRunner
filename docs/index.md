# CodeRunner

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

CodeRunner is a self-hosted, browser-based IDE for teaching FRC robot programming. Students can open a web page, log in, write Java in a real VS Code editor, simulate their robot, inspect telemetry in AdvantageScope, and edit PathPlanner files. There is nothing to install on a student's machine and no per-device setup to maintain. Everything runs on a machine you control and is delivered through the browser.

## How to use CodeRunner

1. Click **Switch project** and load a lesson or import a team project.
2. Follow the lesson instructions or open the files you want to edit.
3. Click **Start** in the Driver Station at the bottom of the page.
4. When robot code and communications are ready, choose a mode and click **Enable**.
5. Use the **AdvantageScope** and **PathPlanner** tabs to inspect telemetry or edit paths.

Use CodeRunner's **Start** button for robot projects, not the WPILib extension's simulation command. Console lessons are the exception: run those with the editor's ▷ button.

## What students get

- **A real VS Code editor in the browser.** Each student works in VSCodium with the Java and WPILib extensions already installed, so they get auto-import, code completion, Ctrl-click into library classes, and inline diagnostics, the same tooling a mentor would use locally.
- **An isolated workspace per student.** Every student gets their own Docker container, so one person's broken build or runaway process never affects anyone else.
- **One-click simulation with a built-in Driver Station.** Clicking **Start** builds the project and starts a WPILib simulation. The Driver Station UI lets students enable the robot, switch modes, and drive with a gamepad.
- **Integrated robot tools.** Robot data streams into AdvantageScope, while PathPlanner edits files in the current project. Both are available beside the editor without a separate install.

## Lessons and team projects

CodeRunner ships with lesson modules that take beginners from plain Java all the way up to a complete WPILib robot, one step at a time. Students choose a lesson from the editor and their workspace fills in with the starting code. When a team is ready to work on its own robot, they can instead import a public GitHub robot project and keep working against their real codebase.

## Self-hosted and modest to run

CodeRunner is designed to run on hardware you already have: a spare classroom machine during the season, or a small cloud VM when you want students to reach it from home. You decide who can log in, and student data lives on your own disk.
