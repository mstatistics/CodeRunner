# Using CodeRunner

## Get started

1. Sign in.
2. Click **Switch project**, then load a lesson or import a public GitHub project.
3. For a lesson, open its README and follow the instructions. For an imported
   project, open the files you want to work on.

:::warning[Switching projects discards your current workspace]

Switching or resetting replaces your current files. For an imported project,
commit and push any work you want to keep.

## Robot lessons and imported projects

:::important[Start the simulation from CodeRunner]

The WPILib extension can start a simulation, but you should not use it here.
Click **Start** in the Driver Station at the bottom of the page so CodeRunner
can use its supported headless simulation setup and connect the controls and
telemetry.

1. Click **Start** in the Driver Station.
2. Wait for **Comms** and **Robot Code** to turn green.

3. Select **Teleop**, **Auto**, or **Test**, then click **Enable**.
4. Click **Stop** when you are finished, or **Restart** to stop the code and re-run with any changes you've made.

Build output and robot output appear in the **Console** tab. Use the top-bar
**AdvantageScope** and **PathPlanner** tabs to switch the tool beside the editor.
AdvantageScope opens by default, and switching tabs does not reload either tool.

## PathPlanner

For robot lessons and imported projects, the **PathPlanner** tab opens the path
editor. For path and auto editing basics, see the
[official PathPlanner guide](https://pathplanner.dev/gui-editing-paths-and-autos.html).

![Pathplanner open alongside the editor, with a path being edited](/img/screenshots/pathplanner-overview.png)

PathPlanner writes to `src/main/deploy/pathplanner/**` in the current project.
Files under `src/main/deploy/choreo/**` are visible but read-only.
If you edit a PathPlanner file directly in VSCodium, refresh the CodeRunner page
before looking for that change in PathPlanner. Switching or resetting the
project reloads PathPlanner with the new project's files.

PathPlanner robot telemetry and hot reload are not connected. Use AdvantageScope
for simulated robot telemetry.

## Console lessons

`Console` type lessons are pure Java exercises, not robot projects. Because they
do not run a robot simulation, the entire simulation and tool pane is hidden.
The VS Code editor expands to fill the full screen. Use the editor's **Run**
button to run them.

## Explore more

While a robot simulation is running, explore the Driver Station's **Auto** and
**Controls** tabs. **Auto** appears when the robot code publishes an autonomous
chooser; **Controls** lets you select a gamepad or keyboard input to control the
simulation.
